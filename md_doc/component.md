Struct containing a component information (temperature and name for the moment).

## Linux

More information can be found at [kernel.org][k].

Note: these may not be present on virtual Linux systems, such as **Docker**
or **Windows Subsystem for Linux**. These hosts do not expose this information
and therefore `Component` elements may be missing or not as expected.

## Windows

Please note that on Windows, you need to have Administrator priviledges to get this
information.
